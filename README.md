Comparing and Contrasting Expert Twitter Accounts on Cybersecurity Utilizing Thesaurus Methods for Text Analytics

The purpose of this project is provide text analytics on a large data set. The large data set consists of thousands of tweets.  The tweets that we will be analyzing are from 10 Cybersecurity related Twitter accounts. By collecting data, we will try to find the difference from each cybersecurity expertâ€™s profile, and compare them. Analyzing this large mass of tweets, we hope to build a Thesaurus containing relevant Cybersecurity related concepts. The steps to create a Thesaurus on this data includes; tokenizing, removing stop words, stemming the data. Through this analysis, we will prove that preprocessing and other machine learning techniques can be used to provide meaningful analysis on a large amount of text data.
